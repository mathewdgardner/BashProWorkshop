###### Exercise 1 <a id="1"></a>

Author a script that takes in any number of arguments and print each of them out on their own lines using separate statements for each.

###### Exercise 2 <a id="2"></a>

Repeat Exercise 1 but have each argument print on the same line with separate statements. An alias would be useful here.

###### Exercise 3 <a id="3"></a>

Author a script that defines a function that prints out the arguments it is given.

###### Exercise 4 <a id="4"></a>

Write a function that combines `cd` and `ls` into one step.  Now you can cd into a folder and automatically list the contents in it.

###### BONUS <a id="bonus"></a>

Repeat Exercise 3 but have the function print out arguments passed to the script instead.
